# Godot Card Game

*A Slay-the-Spire inspired deck-building roguelike showcasing advanced game development techniques*

## üéÆ Portfolio Highlights

### ‚öîÔ∏è Strategic Battle System
Developed a sophisticated turn-based combat engine featuring:
- **State Machine Architecture**: Implemented robust card interaction states (dragging, aiming, targeting) for intuitive gameplay
- **Dynamic Combat Flow**: Created seamless player/enemy turn management with event-driven communication
- **Intelligent UI/UX**: Built responsive battle interface with real-time feedback and smooth animations
- **Modular Design**: Designed scalable enemy AI system supporting diverse combat behaviors and abilities

*Technologies: Godot Engine, GDScript, State Machines, Event Systems*

### üó∫Ô∏è Procedural Map Generation
Engineered an advanced dungeon generation algorithm that creates:
- **Smart Pathfinding**: Developed constraint-based room connections preventing path crossings and ensuring navigable layouts
- **Weighted Random Generation**: Implemented intelligent room distribution using configurable weights for balanced gameplay progression
- **Dynamic Difficulty Scaling**: Created rule-based room placement ensuring proper pacing (early battles, strategic rest stops, epic boss encounters)
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built flexible 15-floor generation system supporting various room types (Combat, Shop, Campfire, Treasure, Boss)

*Technologies: Godot Engine, Procedural Generation, Algorithm Design, Game Balance*

## üîß Technical Achievements
- **Clean Architecture**: Modular codebase with clear separation of concerns
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient rendering and game state management
- **User Experience**: Polished interface with smooth animations and responsive controls
- **Code Quality**: Well-documented, maintainable code following best practices

## üöÄ Quick Demo
*To experience the features highlighted above:*
